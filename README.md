## **Overview and Origin**

* Name of company \
: Robinhood, \
a financial technology company that offers commission-free investing.

* When was the company incorporated? \
: Robinhood was founded on April 18, 2013.

* Who are the founders of the company? \
: Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? \
: Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt met as classmates at Stanford and after graduation they built two finance companies in New York, selling trading software to hedge funds. They learned that executing a trade required account minimums of $500 to $5,000, and while most Americans are typically charged $5 to $10 for every trade, big Wall Street firms pay effectively nothing to trade stocks. 
Two years later in 2013, they moved back to California and founded a company called Robinhood which uses technologies to provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the affluent.


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? \
: Over 18 rounds, Robinhood has raised a total of $2.2B in funding and their latest funding was raised on September 22, 2020 from a Series G round. On March 25, 2019, Robinhood has acquired MarketSnacks. Robinhood is funded by 56 investors including the most recent investors, Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital, and according to PrivCo, Robinhood has a post-money valuation in the range of $10B+ as of August 17, 2020. 


## **Business Activities**

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? \
: The company’s mission is to democratize finance for all, by providing everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the affluent, by leveraging technology to encourage everyone to participate in financial system.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) \
: Robinhood’s intended customer is the masses but the platform is more towards beginner stock market investors using a smartphone, but it is adding more features to compete with large brokerages. \
As of December, 2019, more than 10 million people have accounts on Robinhood, and it saw its customer base soar from 10 million to 13 million during the first four months of 2020, an unprecedented surge beyond anything the company was expecting, as so many people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic and millions of Americans have turned to stock investing in recent months. 
Robinhood stands out as one of the only brokers offering free trades (stock, ETF and options trades), a streamlined trading platform and giving the opportunity for free cryptocurrency trade to investors. \
On September 2, 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Robinhood was under SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) investigation related to not disclosing its practice of selling clients’ orders to high-frequency traders. Robinhood could have to pay a fine of more than $10 million if it agrees to settle. Selling order flow is not illegal in itself and most brokerages do it, however, more of Robinhood’s overall revenue comes from the practice than other brokers. Robinhood made $180 million in trading revenue in the second quarter, doubling from the prior quarter as investors flocked to the platform seeking the historic market rebound.   



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) \
: Robinhood uses technology to reduce the cost for legacy technology, storefront locations, and paper-based accounting. 
They are implementing 22 technologies for Application & Data: Python, NGINX, React, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Redis, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Go, Swift, Memcached, Kotlin, Django REST framework, Celery, Airflow, Rxjava, Faust \
For Utilities, they are implementing 3 technologies: Google Analytics, Elasticsearch, Retrofit \
For DevOps, they are implementing 24 technologies: GitHub, Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Webpack, Kibana, Babel, Sentry, Vagrant, Grafana, Terraform, Logstash, Prometheus, Consul, Zookeeper, ELK, Vault, Fabric, Salt, StatsD, Phabricator, Sensu, LXC\
For Business Tools, they are implementing 4 technologies: Slack, G Suite, Confluence, Asana



## **Landscape**

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? \
: Robo-advisors & Personal Finance

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? \
: Long-term, face-to-face relationships and earned trust over years of interaction for banking and personal finance has been changing due to online digital technology.
For some functions, face-to-face interaction is still important, but online digital technology has allowed customers to manage their financial lives from selecting new products and planning to investing on a computer or mobile device through online intermediaries. \
In the middle of the global coronavirus pandemic, lockdown, and market uncertainty, several companies in personal finance domain have reported a surge in B2B Robo-advisors, digital investing, financial advice and portfolio management globally in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to 2019. For example, Betterment LLC reported an increase in the number of account openings by 25%, and Wealthfront Inc. reported an increase in digital investing activities by 68% since the market downturn.



* What are the other major companies in this domain? \
: Vanguard Personal Advisory Service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Wealthfront, TD Ameritrade Essential & Selective Portfolios, Betterment, Personal Capital, ETrade Core Portfolios, WealthSimple, FutureAdvisor, M1 Finance, Interactive Advisors


## **Results**

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? \
: Robinhood pioneered commission-free stock and ETF trading with no account minimums, and added commission-free options trading, commission-free crypto trading through Robinhood Crypto, Robinhood Gold, Robinhood Snacks newsletter & podcast, and a competitive interest rate on uninvested cash through customer’s brokerage account.\
As a result, there has been changes across the industry causing many big-name online brokers eliminating trading commissions and fees in late 2019, which removed a needless barrier from the financial lives of millions.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? \
: Companies in Financial Advisory Service domain measure AUM as one of their KPIs(Key Performance Indicators: a series of benchmarks that companies use to determine how effective they have been at meeting their goals). I am focusing on AUM and Customer growth here.
1) AUM
Assets Under Management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments that a person or entity manages on behalf of clients. The definitions and formulas vary by company.
Robinhood does not disclose information on its total assets under management. With average account size of $2,000 at Robinhood, brokerage-review.com estimate Robinhood customers assets under management to be around $20 billion.

2) Customer growth
Since Robinhood was launched publicly in 2015, Robinhood quickly became the fastest growing brokerage ever.  Its two million users have transacted over $50 billion and Robinhood Gold, its margin and extended hours service, is also experiencing significant growth, with signups surging 17% month over month, as of April, 2017. As mentioned above, as of December, 2019, more than 10 million people have accounts on Robinhood, and it saw its customer base soar from 10 million to 13 million during the first four months of 2020, an unprecedented surge beyond anything the company was expecting, as so many people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic and millions of Americans have turned to stock investing in recent months. The low costs and zero account minimum requirements are still attracting new traders and investors.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? \
: Based on AUM (Assets Under Management), compared to Vanguard Personal Advisory Service($140 billion), Schwab Intelligent Portfolios($41 billion), Betterment($18 billion), ETrade Core Portfolios($6.2 billion), M1 Finance($0.5 billion), as of June 30, 2019, and considering Robinhood is a new entrant into the world of Personal Finance and its competitor Vanguard ($6.2 trillion in global AUM as of May, 2020) has been around since 1975, Robinhood is performing great relative to its competitors as its estimated AUM in 2020 is roughly $20 billion.
According to 2020 Best Online Brokers reviews by Investopedia, Robinhood earned higher scores than Vanguard in Best Stock Trading Apps, Best for Options, and Best for Day Trading categories.



## **Recommendations**

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) \
: Based on the comparison between Robinhood versus Vanguard in terms of offerings, Robinhood does not offer Robo-advisory while Vanguard started to offer this in 2020. 
I would suggest Robinhood to offer Robo-advisory feature to its customers to be more competitive.



* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? \
: I think automated services enabled by Robo-advisory can attract more customers by providing faster, more accurate and transparent advisory services and recommendations for customers’ portfolio as well as reducing cost for human resources.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? \
: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence would be utilized for Robo-advisory services. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? \
: Robo-advisory services are digital services including automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with minimum human supervision. A Robo-advisor collects financial information from the customers such as their financial situation and their financial goals through online survey or customer’s purchase history and behaviors, and then aggregates the collected data to offer advice and automatically invest customer’s assets. Hence, Robo-advisor will be a great addition to Robinhood to grow its business and become more competitive in the market.
